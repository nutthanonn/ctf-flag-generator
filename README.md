# CTF Flag Generator

This website is a tool for generating CTF (Capture The Flag) flags. These flags are used in cybersecurity competitions, where participants must find and submit flags to earn points. Flags are usually a string of characters that are designed to be difficult to guess, but easy to verify once found.
